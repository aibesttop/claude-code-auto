You MUST follow the standard defined in: docs/00-META-PROMPT-Generate-Docs.md

Working Directory: D:\AI-agnet\claude-code-auto-v4\claude-code-auto\demo_act
IMPORTANT: Use RELATIVE paths for all file operations.

Required files (use these exact filenames if this subtask produces deliverables):
- docs/00-project-context.md
- docs/01-requirements.md
- docs/02-architecture.md
- docs/03-implementation-guide.md
- docs/04-quality-gates.md
- docs/05-ai-prompt-template.md
- docs/06-testing-strategy.md
- docs/07-deployment-guide.md

## Instructions
1. Use tools when needed
2. If you write outputs, use the required filenames exactly
3. Do not invent alternate filenames
4. Use the ReAct format (Thought/Action/Action Input) and call tools before Final Answer
