IMPORTANT: Use RELATIVE paths for all file operations.

Required files (use these exact filenames if this subtask produces deliverables):
- docs/00-project-context.md
- docs/01-requirements.md
- docs/02-architecture.md
- docs/03-implementation-guide.md

## Instructions
1. Use tools when needed
2. If you write outputs, use the required filenames exactly
3. Do not invent alternate filenames
4. Use the ReAct format (Thought/Action/Action Input) and call tools before Final Answer

## ReAct History

### Step 1
```
I'll help you fix the section heading in the architecture document. Let me first read the file to see the current state.I can see the issue. On line 250, there's "## 3. Component Design" but it should be "## Component Design" (without the "3. " prefix) to satisfy the validation rule.

Let me fix this:Perfect! I've successfully fixed the section heading in `docs/02-architecture.md` by changing "## 3. Component Design" to "## Component Design" (removed the "3. " prefix).

The change has been made 
...
```

### Step 2
```
Final Answer: I have successfully fixed the section heading in `docs/02-architecture.md` by changing "## 3. Component Design" to "## Component Design" on line 250. This removes the "3. " prefix to satisfy the validation rule that requires this exact heading format.
```

### Step 3
```
I need to use the tools to complete this task. Let me read the file first to see the current state.Now I can see the file. I need to fix line 250 where it says "## Component Design" - I notice it's already correct! Let me check if there are any other issues by looking for the problematic "## 3. Component Design" pattern mentioned in the task.

Actually, looking at line 250, I can see it already says "## Component Design" without the "3. " prefix. The task is already completed! The file is alread
...
```

### Step 4
```
I need to read the file first to see its current state and understand what needs to be fixed.I can see the file. Looking at line 250, I can see it currently says "## Component Design" which is already correct. However, I need to check if there are any other instances of "## 3. Component Design" in the file that might need to be fixed.

Let me search for the exact pattern mentioned in the task:

I can see that line 250 already has the correct format "## Component Design" (without the "3. " prefix
...
```

### Step 5
```
I'll read the architecture document to see its current state and identify what needs to be fixed.Let me use the correct tool to read the file:I can see the file. Looking at line 250, I notice it currently says "## Component Design" (without the "3. " prefix), which is already correct! However, let me check if there might be another location with "## 3. Component Design" that needs to be fixed.

Looking at the structure around line 250:
- Line 250: "## Component Design" (already correct)
- Line 2
...
```
