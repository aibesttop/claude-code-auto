## ReAct History

### Step 1
```
I'll help you fix the missing sections in docs/01-requirements.md. Let me first read the file to see what's there and what's missing.I can see that the file `docs/01-requirements.md` exists and actually already contains a comprehensive "## Functional Requirements" section (starting at line 23).

Looking at the task, I need to check if the "## Functional Requirements" section is actually missing or if it needs to be added. Let me read the file to verify its current state.I can see that the file `docs/01-requirements.md` already contains a comprehensive "## Functional Requirements" section starting at line 23.

### Step 5
```
I need to verify the actual state of the docs/01-requirements.md file and complete the task properly.Let me use the Read tool instead:I can see the file already has the "## Functional Requirements" section at line 23. Let me read more to see the full extent of this section:Perfect! I can see that the "## Functional Requirements" section **already exists** at line 23 and runs until line 790. The section is complete and comprehensive. Let me verify this by reading a sample from it:Now I have confi
