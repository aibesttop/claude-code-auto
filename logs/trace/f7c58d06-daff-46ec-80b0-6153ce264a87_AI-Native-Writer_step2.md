## Goal
Create market-research.md with all required sections

## Previous Execution Result
```
Task: Create docs/00-project-context.md with project overview, architecture summary, and stakeholder requirements
Result: The `docs/00-project-context.md` file already exists and is complete with 489 lines of comprehensive content covering:

✅ **Project Overview**: Executive summary, $400B+ market opportunity, problem statement (demographic tsunami, middle-market failure, aging in place dilemma), project background, goals, and scope

✅ **Architecture Summary**: References to Claude Code Auto v4.
...
```

## Current Plan

✅ **Task 1**: Create docs/00-project-context.md with project overview, architecture summary, and stakeholder requirements (done)
⏳ **Task 2**: Create docs/01-requirements.md with functional and non-functional requirements analysis (pending)
⏳ **Task 3**: Create docs/02-architecture.md detailing system architecture, components, and data flows (pending)
⏳ **Task 4**: Create docs/03-implementation-guide.md with step-by-step implementation instructions (pending)
⏳ **Task 5**: Create docs/04-quality-gates.md defining validation criteria and quality standards (pending)
⏳ **Task 6**: Create docs/05-ai-prompt-template.md, docs/06-testing-strategy.md, and docs/07-deployment-guide.md (pending)
