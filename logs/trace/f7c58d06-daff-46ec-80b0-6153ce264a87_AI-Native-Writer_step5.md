## Goal
Create market-research.md with all required sections

## Previous Execution Result
```
Task: Fix missing sections in docs/01-requirements.md (add ## Functional Requirements). Use write_file tool to append the missing ## Functional Requirements section with detailed functional requirements for the Claude Code Auto v4 system.
Result: Error: Final Answer provided but no tools were called after 5 consecutive steps.

Validation errors: ['docs/02-architecture.md missing section: ## System Overview', 'docs/02-architecture.md missing section: ## Component Design']

```

## Current Plan

✅ **Task 9**: Fix missing sections in docs/00-project-context.md (add ## Problem Statement) (done)
🔄 **Task 10**: Fix missing sections in docs/01-requirements.md (add ## Functional Requirements) (in_progress)
⏳ **Task 11**: Fix missing sections in docs/02-architecture.md (add ## System Overview and ## Component Design) (pending)
⏳ **Task 12**: Create docs/03-implementation-guide.md with required sections (pending)
⏳ **Task 13**: Create docs/04-quality-gates.md with required sections (pending)
⏳ **Task 14**: Create docs/05-ai-prompt-template.md with required sections (pending)
⏳ **Task 15**: Create docs/06-testing-strategy.md with required sections (pending)
⏳ **Task 16**: Create docs/07-deployment-guide.md with required sections (pending)

## Next Task Decision
```
Fix missing sections in docs/01-requirements.md (add ## Functional Requirements). Read the current file first with read_file tool, then use write_file tool to append the missing ## Functional Requirements section with detailed functional requirements including: task execution modes (Original vs Team), role-based agent system, Leader orchestration, dependency resolution, quality validation, cost control, research tools, and file management capabilities.
