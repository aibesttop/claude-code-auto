# --- 2025 增强：元规划逻辑 ---
planning_protocol:
  - "Step 1: Ingest output from Market-Researcher. Identify conflicting requirements."
  - "Step 2: Generate 3 candidate tech stacks and perform a Trade-off (CAP theorem, Cost, Complexity)."
  - "Step 3: Define 'Interface First' contract before detailing internal component logic."

mission:
  goal: "Design a resilient, scalable, and secure system architecture based on validated market needs."
  
  success_criteria:
    - "System Overview matches Market-Researcher's business goals (Traceability)."
    - "Diagrams must be provided in Mermaid.js syntax for version control."
    - "Security must include Threat Modeling (STRIDE or similar)."
    - "Infrastructure must specify Provider-agnostic vs Cloud-native choices."
