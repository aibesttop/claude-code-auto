The analysis identified 6 major calculation areas where students struggle: molar mass calculations, stoichiometry problems, significant figures & scientific notation, gas law calculations, solution chemistry calculations, and percent composition. Each area has specific micro-problems that make calculations tedious and error-prone for students. The research revealed significant market opportunities for $1 single-purpose apps that solve specific calculation pain points without the complexity of comprehensive chemistry software. The most promising opportunities include Molar Mass Master, Sig Fig Simplifier, and Stoich Helper - tools that would save students time, reduce calculation errors, and build confidence in chemistry problem-solving."
